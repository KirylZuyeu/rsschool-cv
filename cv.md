## Summary ##

I like the process of learning and self-development. I want to get a Front-End Developer position and then will be a team leader in a large IT-company from the coming few years. This will be a proof to myself and others that if you work hard and manage your discipline, you can always change your life and sphere of activity. My main quality is a conscientious attitude to work and focus on the results. Also, I have an extensive experience of managing people, which will help me to be a great team leader.
